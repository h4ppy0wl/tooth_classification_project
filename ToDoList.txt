done! 1. complete def parse_dataset_json() based on the json structure
done! 2. edit the down stream functions to make them compatible to records that are Dict and have "augmentation_label"
done! 3. edit augmentation if statement in the create_tf_dataset()
done! 4. wrap the preprocess_record() in the tf graph for dataset generation
done! 5. test dataset generation and view the images inside the dataset and their label
done! 6. create the model for ResNet50 only and check if it does the fitting
done! 6.1 added attention mechanism option
6.2 implement the resized mask option for dataset creation
    it needs to have the rle info for plaque and create the attention mask based on that.
    add the resizing step to the tf_ds function.






7. add the option of another model and check if it works
8. generalize the model selection
